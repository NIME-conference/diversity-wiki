# Diversity at NIME

Our goal is to create an inclusive and respectful conference environment that invites participation from people of all ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, and sexual orientations.  This wiki space is a place to find resources on why diversity matters, to find out how you can help make NIME a more welcoming place, and suggest ways for us to make NIME more inclusive too.

### Online Diversity Workshop Jan 14-16th 2021 \(TBD\)

Please join us for a 2-3 hr zoom workshop in early January where we discuss what we can do to improve diversity and inclusivity within NIME over both the long and short term.

#### Topics

* Present results from the NIME 2020 diversity study and discuss comments and suggestions such as:
  * Setting up a sibling system to help newcomers to the community navigate NIME language and get the most out of conference attendence
  * English-as-first-language editing assistance for those with great research, but not as great English skills and limited funds to hire assistance. 
* Develop a mentorship program.
* Financial and geographical impediments to NIME participation.
* A diversity workshop for NIME 2021.

We welcome additional ideas and suggestions for discussion and hope this workshop can yield some well defined actionable items.  If you are interested in joining, please contact one of the diversity team members.
