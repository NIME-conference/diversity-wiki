# Welcome

Our goal is to create an inclusive and respectful conference environment that invites participation from people of all ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, and sexual orientations. This wiki space is a place to find resources on why diversity matters, to find out how you can help make NIME a more welcoming place, and suggest ways for us to make NIME more inclusive too.
For the full official diversity statement see: https://www.nime.org/diversity/
We welcome additional ideas for discussion and action. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or would like to volunteer please contact one of the diversity team members.
