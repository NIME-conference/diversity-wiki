# Discussion Topics

Topics of discussion will include, but are not limited to:

1\) How is NIME and the NIME research context exclusionary to people with disabilities, from VI, to neurodivergence and more? What can we do to improve our inclusivity?   
  
 2\) What would local NIME chapters look like and how can we make them work? What would/could be the benefit?
 
 3\) Usually NIME is an in-person conference and most people travel. However, this excludes those without access to the financial resources to attend. What can we do to make a remote conference experience as rewarding and beneficial as being there in person?   
  
 4\) How could NIME be more relevant, engaging, and rewarding for those outside the academic tech. community, for instance, artists, performers, and makers?   
  
 5\) What is NIME’s responsibility to foster cultural exchange and how to make that occur, especially in the context of the conference itself?   
  
 6\) Why is gender parity a persistent problem at NIME? Why have past efforts not worked? What new actions/strategies can we take to improve?   
  
 7\) How could mentorship address issues of underrepresentation?   
  
 8\) Who does the diversity work? How do we reward meaningful diversity work within the community and share the work between everyone?   
  
 9\) The vast majority of the people who present at, attend, and perform at NIME are white. What are the reasons for this? What needs to change?   
  
 10\) How can we improve and continue the sheparding scheme \(English or NIME Academic-as-a-second-language\)?   
  
 11\) How can we make a sustainable scholarship program and how do we best use it to reach our goals of improved representation?   
  
 12\) For those people attending NIME without a supervisor to guide them through “how to get the most from NIME”, how could we implement a NIME buddy system for the conference \(and conferences going forward\)?   
  
 13\) How do we track improvements \(or non-improvements\) of inclusivity and diversity within NIME? How do we measure success?   
  
 14\) How do we define diversity and inclusion within NIME?   
  
 15\) What do you want to discuss? Suggestions welcome!
