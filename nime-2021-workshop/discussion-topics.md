# Discussion Topics

Topics of discussion may include, but are not limited to:

* How is NIME and the NIME research context exclusionary to people with disabilities, from VI, to neurodivergence and more? What can we do to improve our inclusivity?
* What would local NIME chapters look like and how can we make them work? What would/could be the benefit? 
* Usually NIME is an in-person conference and most people travel. However, this excludes those without access to the financial resources to attend. What can we do to make a remote conference experience as rewarding and beneficial as being there in person?
* How could NIME be more relevant, engaging, and rewarding for those outside the academic tech. community, for instance, artists, performers, and makers? 
* What is NIME’s responsibility to foster cultural exchange and how to make that occur, especially in the context of the conference itself?
* Why is gender parity a persistent problem at NIME? Why have past efforts not worked? What new actions/strategies can we take to improve? 
* How could mentorship address issues of underrepresentation?
* Who does the diversity work? How do we reward meaningful diversity work within the community and share the work between everyone?
* The vast majority of the people who present at, attend, and perform at NIME are white. What are the reasons for this? What needs to change?
* How can we improve and continue the sheparding scheme (English or NIME Academic-as-a-second-language)?
* How can we make a sustainable scholarship program and how do we best use it to reach our goals of improved representation?
* For those people attending NIME without a supervisor to guide them through “how to get the most from NIME”, how could we implement a NIME buddy system for the conference (and conferences going forward)?
* How do we track improvements (or non-improvements) of inclusivity and diversity within NIME? How do we measure success?
* How do we define diversity and inclusion within NIME?
* What do you want to discuss?
