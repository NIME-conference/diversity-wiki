## Actions We can Take to Improve Diversity and Inclusivity at NIME

![The logical symbol &#x2200; \(read as &quot;for all&quot;\) with the Philadelphia Pride Flag in the background.](../.gitbook/assets/frame-4.png)

NIME has a diversity problem, and it remains largely white, male, American-European, able-bodied and English-speaking \(1\). We believe that groups with important insights and experiences are being underrepresented within NIME as authors \(such as non-male people, those who do not speak English as a first language, those with disabilities, and those of other races and ethnicities, just to name a few\), and that this underrepresentation means that important ideas and viewpoints that come from a wider range of lived experiences are missing.

Initial efforts to draw attention to diversity within NIME were in response to a lack of gender diversity, such as analyses of NIME’s women authors \[1\]\[2\], a 2018 workshop on gender diversity in the community \(2\), the establishment of the WiNIME directory \(3\) and a 2014 panel discussion that resulted in an article \[3\]. The NIME diversity statement \(4\) and the Pamela Z Award were established in 2018 \(5\) in an effort to foster a larger conversation around broader diversity in this community. However, far more work still needs to be done: In 2020 strong critique emerged of NIME’s lack of political agenda \[4\], as well as NIME’s current epistemological crises \[5\], and we acknowledge that our conversation about diversity cannot be centred on a limited number of special interest groups, but must instead extend more widely.

“Diversity” is a complex term. At its simplest diversity describes differences within a group \(usually across lines of identity such as race, gender, sexuality, and so on\). However, simply acknowledging diversity does not address the structures of power that contribute to a lack of diversity in the first place \[6\], and here we acknowledge that simply pointing out differences does not go far enough.

We propose extending this existing community work by viewing a lack of diversity through an intersectional lens. Intersectionality, coined by Crenshaw in 1989 \[7\], refers to the interconnectedness of all discrimination and the common roots in structural inequality \(and, most importantly, that focusing on a single axis of discrimination undermines anti-discrimination more widely\). With this workshop, we aim to be a point of departure for community discussion, not to address diversity within NIME in one strata \(such as gender\), but instead to examine the wider structures within the community that include some and exclude others, and to develop strategies to address them. In 2021 we have already begun a trial English-as-second-language assistance program and are developing financial scholarships, ideas drawn from the 2020 NIME diversity survey and subsequent discussions in collaboration with the NIME Ethical and Environmental workgroups, but this is just a start. We see this workshop as a an opportunity for “transforming silence into language and action” \[8\]; strategy is, as Ahmed states, “not only thought in action but thought sharpened by action.” \[9\]

Laurel is a software engineer for Ableton Live and diversity officer for NIME. She has held Postdoctoral Fellowships at Queen’s University Belfast, Aalborg University Copenhagen, and Queen Mary University of London where she also obtained her PhD having previously obtained multiple degrees from the Massachussets Institute of Technology. Dr. Pardue specialises in embedded programming, sensor interactions, and real-time audio programming. With a firm grounding in musical practice, she was the lead engineer on the recently released electronic Tabla Touch with Keda Music and Kuljit Bhamra; Gamelan Elektrika, a gamelan interface that debuted with Kronos Quartet at NY’s Lincoln Center; and a hybrid-electro-accoustic violin that placed 3rd at the 2020 International Guthman Musical Instrument Competition. Dr. Pardue has toured Europe as violinist in multiple projects including appearances on BBC Radios 2-6 as well as serving as a UN Peacekeeper in Liberia.

**Juan P. Martinez Avila, The University of Nottingham**  
Juan is a Computer Science PhD candidate at the Mixed Reality Laboratory in the University of Nottingham, and a diversity officer for NIME. His work explores ecologically-informed design approaches for new guitar technologies, with a particular interest in performance preparation activities, i.e. learning and rehearsing guitar repertoires. Juan's current design research is grounded on ethnographic studies, participatory design, and soma design, and has received honourable mention awards at CHI 2019 and CHI 2021. As a diversity officer Juan is interested in exploring ways of promoting the work of people from the Global South at NIME, as well as facilitating their access to the conference and collaboration with the global NIME community.
