Action To Improve Diversity and Inclusivity at NIME

Description {#description-up-to-750-words}
===========

NIME has a diversity problem, and is remains largely white, male,
American-European, able-bodied and English-speaking[1]{#n843srghteb

date-structured-value=""}. We believe that groups with important
insights and experiences are being underrepresented within NIME as
authors (such as non-male people, those who do not speak English as a
first language, those with disabilities, and those of other races and
ethnicities, just to name a few), and that this underrepresentation
means that important ideas and viewpoints that come from a wider range
of lived experiences are missing.

Initial efforts to draw attention to diversity within NIME were in
response to a lack of gender diversity, such as analyses of NIME's women

around broader diversity in this community. However, far more work still
needs to be done: In 2020 strong critique emerged of NIME's lack of

}" unstructured-value=""}, and we acknowledge that our conversation
about diversity cannot be centred on a limited number of special
interest groups, but must instead extend more widely.

"Diversity" is a complex term. At its simplest diversity describes
differences within a group (usually across lines of identity such as
race, gender, sexuality, and so on). However, simply acknowledging
diversity does not address the structures of power that contribute to a
lack of diversity in the first place[\[6\]]{#njg6h1rvcj2 .citation
node-type="citation" data-value="@article{puritty2017without,

  number={6356},
  pages={1101--1102},
  year={2017},
  publisher={American Association for the Advancement of Science}
}" unstructured-value=""}, and here we acknowledge that simply pointing
out differences does not go far enough.

We propose extending this existing community work by viewing a lack of
diversity through an intersectional lens. Intersectionality, coined by
Crenshaw in 1989[\[7\]]{#n8j5w4hsfaj .citation node-type="citation"
data-value="@article{crenshaw1989demarginalizing,

  author={Crenshaw, Kimberl{\\'e}},
  journal={u. Chi. Legal f.},
  pages={139},
  year={1989},
  publisher={HeinOnline}
}" unstructured-value=""}, refers to the interconnectedness of all
discrimination and the common roots in structural inequality (and, most
importantly, that focusing on a single axis of discrimination undermines
anti-discrimination more widely). With this workshop, we aim to be a
point of departure for community discussion, not to address diversity
within NIME in one strata (such as gender), but instead to examine the
wider structures within the community that include some and exclude
others, and to develop strategies to address them. In 2021 we have
already begun a trial English-as-second-language assistance program and
are developing financial scholarships, ideas drawn from the 2020 NIME
diversity survey and subsequent discussions in collaboration with the
NIME Ethical and Environmental workgroups, but this is just a start. We
see this workshop as a an opportunity for "transforming silence into
language and action"[\[8\]]{#n0thb8g1ap4 .citation node-type="citation"

  author={Lorde, Audre},
  journal={Identity politics in the women’s movement},
  pages={81--84},
  year={1977}
}" unstructured-value=""}; strategy is, as Ahmed states, "not only
thought in action but thought sharpened by action."[\[9\]]{#nomaq14lm3u

Workshop activities
-------------------

We will begin this workshop by introducing the diversity officers. We
will also share the results from our NIME 2020 diversity survey, and
share initiatives that are currently underway.

Next, musician and activist Kim Macari will give a presentation on
topics relevant to this area in order to orient attendees around
intersectional diversity thinking, such as the myth of meritocracy,
signalling vs normalisation, effective methods for talking about
diversity and inclusion, and building healthy teams.

Then, we will invite workshop attendees to participate in 3 rounds of
active discussion in breakout rooms of 4-5 people, using Discord. The
goal is to focus on action, brainstorming ways of addressing various
issues facing the NIME community and strategising methods of
implementation. Teams are encouraged to take notes in Padlet, as groups
will share their ideas afterwards.

Topics of discussion may include, but are not limited to:

-   Inclusivity of NIME research on disability

-   Decolonizing NIME research

-   Feminist design approaches in NIME research

-   Quotas for NIME participation

-   Work across borders, and fostering international collaboration

-   Mentorship programmes for research within NIME.

-   Financial impediments to NIME participation: freelancers, artists,
    communities that are not as privileged

-   Geographical impediments to NIME participation: remote
    participation, accessibility, and attendance sponsorships

-   Collecting/publishing/open data on NIME attendees

-   How to encourage/collaborate with local communities/hack-spaces etc

We will end with a call to action (request for volunteers).

Short Description {#short-description-up-to-70-words}
=================

Addressing and fostering diversity within NIME is a complex endeavour,
as diversity itself is a multifaceted concept. In this workshop we aim
to discuss the existing diversity issues in NIME with members of the
community, concerning access, gender, ethnical, financial,
institutional, and epistemological disparities. We will also discuss the
initiatives that are being put forward by the diversity officers and
will call for action and volunteers.

and creates graphic scores, often using ekphrasis and data sonification.

Macari also occupies a number of key positions within the arts world -
Programmer for Vortex Jazz Club (ranked in Top 10 jazz venues in the
world 2020), Chair of pan-national support body Jazz Promotion Network
and is on the Music Team at Arts Council England. She often appears as a
cultural commentator at a range of events and publications on topics
including gender politics in the arts, diversity and inclusion, cultural
identity and the implications of political decision making on the arts.

Preferred Length of Workshop
============================

Half-day (3 hours)

Technical and Space Requirements
================================

We will aim for a blended mode, where participants may join the workshop
physically at the conference as well as remotely. A set of materials
will be provided prior to the workshop using an asynchronous learning
approach. We will use Discord (or NIME2021 recommended alternative) to
create a server and run multiple voice channels for each of our
discussion activities in breakout rooms and plenaries, and chat rooms
for participants to have threaded conversations. During the breakout
discussions we will also use Padlet for participants to post notes and
comments.

As discussions groups will be kept small to best encourage individual
engagement (which we already tested in our trial online workshop in
January 2021), discussion sessions can be run periodically throughout
the day for different audiences across different time zones.
